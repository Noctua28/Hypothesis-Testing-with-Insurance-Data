# Hypothesis Testing with Insurance Data
 
For this project we using our hypothesis testing skills to answer the following questions:

For Q1, we conducted a two-sample t-test to compare the insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers. The null hypothesis was rejected, indicating that smokers have significantly higher insurance charges than non-smokers. The supporting visualization was a box plot comparing the charges for both groups.

For Q2, we performed a chi-square test of independence to examine the association between gender and smoking status. The null hypothesis was rejected, suggesting that there is a significant difference in smoking rates between men and women, with men being more likely to smoke. The supporting visualization was a stacked bar chart illustrating the distribution of smokers and non-smokers among men and women.

For Q3, we utilized a one-way ANOVA to determine if there are differences in average charges among different regions. The null hypothesis was rejected, indicating that there are variations in average charges across regions. The supporting visualization was a box plot displaying the distribution of charges for each region.

For each question we performed the following:

1.State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis

2.Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples

3.Test the assumptions of your selected test.

4.Execute the selected test, or the alternative test (if you do not meet the assumptions)

5.Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis 

6.Show a supporting visualization that helps display the result

Once completed we were able to reach a conclusion for all three questions.
